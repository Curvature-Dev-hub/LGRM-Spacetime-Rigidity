# Local Geometric Resonance Manifold (LGRM)
**Field Theory of Spacetime Rigidity & Energy Transmission**

This repository contains the official LaTeX source code and pre-print PDF for the LGRM framework, which proposes a "Substantial Spacetime" model to explain galactic rotation curves without Dark Matter.

## 🌌 Core Concepts
- **Substantial Spacetime**: Spacetime as a physical rigid medium with a fundamental constant $\Gamma = 4.2501638 \times 10^{15} m^2/s$.
- **Core Vorticity Engine**: The galactic center acts as a primary power source.
- **Whip Effect**: Kinetic energy is transmitted from the core to the disk edge through spacetime rigidity, regulated by $\tanh(L/L_H)$.
- Note: 
L is defined as R
 (the radial observation point), representing the dynamic lever arm of spacetime torque transmission.

## 📊 Key Validation Results
Our model shows high consistency with observational data without artificial parameter tuning:
* **Milky Way Residual**: -6.6 km/s
* **Andromeda (M31) Residual**: -36 km/s




  
  


## 🤖 AI Computational Protocol
The numerical validation of the LGRM field equations was facilitated by **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Paid Tier)**. 
- **Protocol**: Strict **"Non-Compliance Mode"**.
- **Constraint**: No data smoothing or artificial curve-fitting was allowed.
- **Responsibility**: All reported residuals are direct raw outputs from the AI computational agency.

- # LGRM: Local Geometric Resonance Manifold Validation

This repository provides the numerical validation for the **LGRM Theory**, proving that galactic rotation curves can be explained by **Substantial Spacetime Rigidity** without the need for dark matter.
