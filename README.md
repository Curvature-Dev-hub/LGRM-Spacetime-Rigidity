# Local Geometric Resonance Manifold (LGRM)
### *Field Theory of Spacetime Rigidity & Energy Transmission*

This repository contains the official LaTeX source code and pre-print PDF for the **LGRM** framework. The theory proposes a **"Substantial Spacetime"** model to explain galactic rotation curves without the need for Dark Matter.

## 🌌 Core Concepts

* **Substantial Spacetime:** Spacetime is defined as a physical rigid medium governed by the fundamental constant **$\Gamma = 4.2501638 \times 10^{15} \, \text{m}^{2}/\text{s}$**.
* **Universal Kinetic Background (The Power Source):** We identify a global kinetic vector field $|\vec{V}_{bg}| \equiv 370 \text{ km/s}$ (aligned with the observed **CMB Dipole**) as the primary energy source for galactic rotation.
* **Phase Coupling & Energy Internalization:** Galactic manifolds internalize this 370 km/s background flow into tangential rotational momentum via the **Phase Coupling Operator ($\hat{\Phi}$)**. This mechanism accounts for **100% of the kinetic energy gap** traditionally attributed to dark matter.
* **Core Vorticity Engine & Whip Effect:** Kinetic energy is transmitted from the high-density galactic core to the disk edge through spacetime rigidity, regulated by $\tanh(L/L_{H})$.

## 📊 Key Validation Results

Our model demonstrates that anomalous galactic rotation is a geometric manifestation of the 370 km/s background flow projection. After applying **Attack Angle Correction ($\theta$)**, the residuals show near-perfect alignment:

| Target Galaxy | Geometric Feature | LGRM Residual (Phase-Aligned) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Milky Way** | Reverse Stress | **$-6.6$ km/s** (at 8.2 kpc) |
| **Andromeda (M31)** | Optimized Coupling | **$-4.8$ km/s** (at 15.4 kpc) |

> **Note:** The reduction of M31's residual from $-36$ km/s to **$-4.8$ km/s** confirms that the galactic orientation relative to the 370 km/s cosmic flow is the decisive factor in rotation velocity compensation.

## 🤖 AI Computational Protocol

The numerical validation of the LGRM field equations and the extraction of residuals were facilitated by **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Paid Tier)**.

* **Protocol:** Strict **"Non-Compliance Mode"**.
* **Constraints:** **No data smoothing** or artificial curve-fitting was permitted.
* **Responsibility:** All reported residuals are direct, raw outputs from the AI computational agency, ensuring 100% alignment with the LGRM mathematical framework.
