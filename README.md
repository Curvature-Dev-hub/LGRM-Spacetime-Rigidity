# Local Geometric Resonance Manifold (LGRM)

This repository contains the full theoretical framework and numerical validation for the LGRM model, which proposes "Substantial Spacetime" as a rigid continuum to explain galactic rotation curves without the need for Dark Matter.

## Theoretical Core
- **Substantial Spacetime**: Postulating spacetime as a physical medium with intrinsic rigidity ($\Gamma$).
- **Core Vorticity Engine**: The galactic center acts as a power source transmitting kinetic energy.
- **Whip Effect**: Dynamic energy conduction through the spacetime medium.

## Key Results
- **Milky Way Residual**: -6.6 km/s
- **Andromeda (M31) Residual**: -36 km/s

## AI Computational Protocol
Numerical validations were performed using **Gemini 1.5 Pro (Paid Tier)** under a strict **Non-Compliance Mode** to ensure data integrity and prevent artificial curve-fitting.
